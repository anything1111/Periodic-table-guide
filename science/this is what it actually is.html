	<h6></h6><p1> The periodic table is a table of chemical elements organizes elements into columns (groups) and rows (periods) that have similar characteristics. At room temperature, these qualities influence an element's physical state—gas, solid, or liquid—as well as its chemical reactivity, or ability to form chemical bonds with other atoms. The periodic table shows the element's relative atomic mass, which is the weighted average of its naturally occurring isotopes on Earth.</p1>
	<h2>Here's some fun facts so that you know more about it </h2>
	<div>1. Dmitri Mendeleyev is the inventor of the modern periodic table
Dmitri Mendeleyev presented his periodic table of the elements based on increasing atomic weight on March 6, 1869, at the Russian Chemical Society.

	<p2>
Though he is often cited as the inventor of the modern periodic table, did you know that his table wasn't the first attempt to organize the elements according to periodic properties? In 1864, Lothar Meyer published a periodic table that described the placement of 28 elements.</p2>

	<p3>2. Scientists used battery polarity to weigh the elements
In order to determine the weight of each of the 63 known elements at the time, scientists passed currents through several solutions to break them up into the atoms of specific elements.

Batteries were used to separate the atoms — their polarity would make atoms of one element go in one direction and others in another. The atoms were then collected in separate containers and weighed.</p3>

	<p4>3. The periodic table reflects its creator's love for card games
		<h5></h5>
Dmitri Mendeleyev enjoyed playing card games. That's why he scribbled the weight of each constituent on a separate index card and sorted them like solitaire cards.</p4>
