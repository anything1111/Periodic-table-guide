<p1>The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, which characterizes a chemical element and determines its position in the periodic table. Atomic numbers increase from left to right on the periodic table based on different groups. For example, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 and helium has an atomic number of 2. <br>
	
	 
	The atomic mass is the average number of protons and neutrons in an element's atoms after accounting for the element's isotopes' natural abundances. As you proceed around the chart, you’ll notice that the atomic mass of each element rises. This means that simply looking at a piece might reveal a lot about its weight. Because the mass is derived by adding protons and neutrons  together in each element’s atom. The atomic mass and the protons  increase across or down the table, with each element, resulting in an increase in weight. This is because the electrons contribute far less to the atom’s weight than protons and neutrons which are not included in the atomic mass.

Atomic symbol: are represented by the first or second letter of atom’s English name, with some exceptions for example, ‘au’ represents gold by its Latin name ‘aurum’.

Electron valency:
The number of valence electrons in neutral atoms equals the atom's main group number. The major group number for an element may be found in its periodic table column. Carbon, for example, belongs to group 4 and contains four valence electrons. Group 6 oxygen contains 6 valence electrons. The valence shell is the outermost shell, and valence electrons are the electrons that reside there. It is the most stable and least reactive when an atom's outermost electron shell is filled. </p1>
